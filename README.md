**Understanding Water and Ion Transport Behavior through Polyamide Membranes**
- Studied the free energy change when various salt solutions (0.6 mol/L of NaCl, LiCl, NaF, KCl, RbCl, CsCl, NaBr and NaI) through hydrated PA membranes using all-atom MD simulations with GROMACS and the umbrella sampling method.
- Conducted a comprehensive analysis of potential of mean force (PMF) results to elucidate the mechanisms of water and ion transport through PA membranes, focusing on factors such as hydrogen bonding, hydration shells, migration trajectories, and coordination numbers.
- Discovered shortcomings in the umbrella sampling method for predicting free energy and proposed a new computational approach to provide more accurate free energy calculations for water and ion transport through hydrated PA membranes.
